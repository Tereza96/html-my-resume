<h1>About me</h1>

<p>My name is Tereza and I moved to Canada from Czechia in July 2020 
    to seek my new adventure. I chased my dream and now I am living in 
    the most beautiful mountain town in the middle of Canadian Rockies. 
 </p>
 <p>I managed to obtain my permanent residency in August 2023 and I am 
    working towards my canadian citizenship.
 </p>

 <p>More about me soon...</p>
